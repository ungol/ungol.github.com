<h2>Our History</h2>

<h3>Football.</h3>

	<p>The bittersweet love for the game that can leave you in a state of unbelievable euphoria just as easily as it can leave you on your knees, weeping, like a helpless child. A game where differences are forgotten and nothing else matters for 90 minutes.</p>

  <p>It's a game of skill and balance and composure. For at any given time <em>the difference is one.</em> Just one. The difference between a commanding win or a devastating loss; sheer bliss or utter humiliation; absolute brilliance or crushing disappointment.</p>

	<p>You know this game is anything but a game and you need someone that will stand by you every step of the way. You need a company that understands the sport, and matches your love and passion for the beautiful game. <em>Ungol Soccer</em> is that company.</p>
	
<h2>Our Founder</h2>

	<p>Dave's obsession for soccer began at the ripe age of 4, in Southern California. He loved the sport so much, he insisted on wearing his only soccer outfit everywhere he went...7 days a week. Times have changed and he now bathes and has one footy outfit for each day of the week to keep him from looking like a slob. His entire life has revolved around football...the <em>real</em> football.</p> In fact, there have been rumors that he grazes around soccer fields, sleeps in nets, and breathes in only air filtered through
	
	<p>His family began a small soccer shop when he was 6 and he has worked there since. He's done everything from cleaning toilets and sweeping to, finally, the more respectable role of store manager. Dave's passion for both retail and the soccer collided in the formation of Ungol. </p>
