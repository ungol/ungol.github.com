<h2>Week 1. Day 1. The Birth</h2>
<h3>March 13, 2011</h3>

<p>I have finally arrived. It’s the beginning of the road. The road to realize a dream I have waited much too long to realize. I am running the soccer retail shop known today as Deportes Salazar in Ontario, CA. With some good management and lots of learning, I will pave the way to the construction of my dream…Ungol Soccer.</p>

<p>What is Ungol Soccer? Other than my vision of soccer retail in America, it’s an experience. It’s passion. It’s energy. It’s live. It’s a place where football athletes and fans can meet; a place where footballers go to find anything and everything related to the sport. Ungol Soccer encompasses all that into your shopping experience. It will bottle all the excitement of going to a live game into YOUR retail experience. Yes, we’ll have the gear your looking for; but we all know it’s rarely about the schwagg and more about finding a place that understands us. That’s what Ungol is. The place created by footballers, for footballers.</p>

<p>Mission number 1… the ole inventory trick. We’ll be taking inventory all night tomorrow (hopefully with some help from friends) and working on some fresh accounts with “up and coming” brands over the next few days.</p>

<p>In the coming months, we’ll be hosting viewing parties for EPL, La Liga, Serie A, FMF, MLS, Champions League, etc. If you’d like to take part in these exciting events sign up to our Facebook page or follow us on Twitter (Ungol Soccer).</p>
